# My Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal dotfiles, as well as wallpapers.

## Configs
All configs are to be used with the `stow` utility. Included are configs for `compton`, `herbstluftwm`, `lighthouse`, `sublime` and `urxvt`.

## npm-snippets
Some npm-snippets are needed from my [npm-snippets](https://github.com/paulavery/npm-snippets) repository for all of this to properly work.

## Wallpapers
Wallpapers and color themes are provided in [wpmanager](.wpmanager) and are generated and used by my [wpmanager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpmanager) utility.
