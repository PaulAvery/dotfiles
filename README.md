# My Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal dotfiles, as well as install scripts and wallpapers.

Most of the files are copied/stolen together from all over the place :)

## Setup
Setup scripts are provided under [setup](setup). Run [setup/base/pacstrap.sh](setup/base/pacstrap.sh) after mounting your partitions to `/mnt` and `/mnt/boot` to run pacstrap and general installation on a new install. I **STRONGLY** advise to read the scripts first to understand what they do, they are extensively commented.

## Wallpapers
Wallpapers and color themes are provided in [.wpmanager](.wpmanager) and are generated and used by my [wpmanager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpmanager) utility.
